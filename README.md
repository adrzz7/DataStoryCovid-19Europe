Visualizing the Outbreak: Subnational COVID-19 Data in Europe.

Created a Data Story from a Covid 19 in Europe dataset by using Tableau.

My data set is file name is europe-coronavirus-covid-19-subnational-cases-1.csv. It contains the number of confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths by country and subnational region due to the Coronavirus pandemic in Europe.

In designing the visualizations for the data story, I followed Shaffer's 4Cs, which includes four key principles: Clear, Clean, Concise, and Captivating. Here's how the visualizations in the data story fulfil each of these design principles.
